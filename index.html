      <h1>Kayleb's CS Project Portfolio</h1>      
      <p>I am very interested in history and and I enjoy playing a lot of video games and board games with my mom. I like Computer Science because it gives me a chance to look into the world of coding and see what I can do. Some of my strengths is that I'm a hard worker and I can be dedicated to a cause if I really put my mind towards it and I'm passionate about it. I am experinced in p5.js and HTML coding.</p>

        <p><a href="https://codehs.com/sandbox/id/final-p5js-project-zPNrvx?collaborate=-OQQ2k2lTjXBp24ZSxIv">Link to project</a></p>
        <p>A small 3 player game that simulates the common game of tag online. This project demonstrats the peak of my skills, being the biggest project I've made thus far and it shows my current experince coding to its fullest extent. I made the project with 2 other students which helped me complete the project in a timely matter and assisted my learning.</p>

        <p>This here is a small animation I made showing a simple moon and mars going back and fourth in space. It shows my skills in p5.js and it demonstrats my skill in making movement codes in p5.js.</p>

        <p><a href="https://fragility.onrender.com/">Website</a></p>
        <p>For this project I made a wbesite that tracked the fragility of countries from 1995-2018 based off of the CSP's rankings. It showcases my skill in python coding and my ability to make graphs correlating with data.</p>

        <p><a href="https://secure-quiz-app-c38i.onrender.com/">Website</a></p>
        <p>In this app I made a quiz app that ran you through some basic math problems and told you if the answers you put were wrong or correct at the end of the test, and then the ability to restart the test. This project showed my skills in python and HTML, showing that I know how to work inbetween the two.</p>
